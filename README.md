# Dwolla SDK for C#

This repository contains the source code for Dwolla's C#-based SDK, which allows developers to
interact with Dwolla's server-side API via a C# API. Any action that can be performed via an HTTP
request can be made using this SDK when executed within a server-side environment.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To begin using this SDK, you will first need to download it to your machine. We use
[NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dwolla.Client) to distribute this package. Check out the
[Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio)
documentation for more information on how to install and manage packages from Nuget using Visual Studio.

Here's an example using the
[Package Manager Console](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-powershell?view=vsmac-2022)

```shell
$ Install-Package Dwolla.Client -Version 5.2.2
```

### Initialization

Before any API requests can be made, you must first determine which environment you will be using,
as well as fetch the application key and secret. To fetch your application key and secret, please
visit one of the following links:

- Production: https://dashboard.dwolla.com/applications
- Sandbox: https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com/applications

Finally, you can create an instance of `DwollaClient` by specifying which environment you will be using—Production or Sandbox—via the `isSandbox` boolean flag.

```csharp
var client = DwollaClient.Create(isSandbox: true);
```

#### Tokens

Application access tokens are used to authenticate against the API on behalf of an application.
Application tokens can be used to access resources in the API that either belong to the application
itself (`webhooks`, `events`, `webhook-subscriptions`) or the Dwolla Account that owns the
application (`accounts`, `customers`, `funding-sources`, etc.). Application tokens are obtained by
using the [`client_credentials`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) OAuth grant type:

```csharp
var tokenRes = await client.PostAuthAsync<AppTokenRequest, TokenResponse>(
    new Uri($"{client.AuthBaseAddress}/token"),
    new AppTokenRequest {Key = "...", Secret = "..."});
```

_Application access tokens are short-lived: 1 hour. They do not include a `refresh_token`. When it
expires, generate a new one using `AppTokenRequest`._

## Making Requests

Once you've created a `DwollaClient`, currently, you can make low-level HTTP requests.

### Low-Level Requests

To make low-level HTTP requests, you can use the `GetAsync()`, `PostAsync()`, `UploadAsync()` and
`DeleteAsync()` methods with the available
[request models](https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-csharp/blob/main/Dwolla.Client/Models/Requests).
These methods will return responses that can be mapped to one of the available
[response models](https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-csharp/blob/main/Dwolla.Client/Models/Responses).

#### Setting Headers

To specify headers for a request (e.g., `Authorization`), you can pass a `Headers` object as the last argument.

```csharp
var headers = new Headers {{"Authorization", $"Bearer {tokenRes.Content.Token}"}};
client.GetAsync<GetCustomersResponse>(url, headers);
```

#### `GET`

```csharp
// GET api.dwolla.com/customers
var url = new Uri("https://api.dwolla.com/customers");
client.GetAsync<GetCustomersResponse>(url);
```

#### `POST`

```csharp
// POST api.dwolla.com/customers
var url = new Uri("https://api.dwolla.com/customers/");
var request = new CreateCustomerRequest
{
  FirstName = "Jane",
  LastName = "Doe",
  Email = "jane.doe@email.com"
};
var res = await PostAsync<CreateCustomerRequest, EmptyResponse>(url, request, headers);
//res.Response.Headers.Location => "https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/fc451a7a-ae30-4404-aB95-e3553fcd733f

// POST api.dwolla.com/customers/{id}/documents multipart/form-data foo=...
var url = new Uri("https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/{id}/documents");
var request = new UploadDocumentRequest
{
    DocumentType = "idCard",
    Document = new File
    {
        ContentType = "image/png",
        Filename = "filename.jpg",
        Stream = fileStream
    }
};
client.UploadAsync<UploadDocumentRequest, EmptyResponse>(url, request, headers);
```

#### `DELETE`

```csharp
// DELETE api.dwolla.com/resource
var url = "https://api.dwolla.com/labels/{id}"
client.DeleteAsync<object>(url, null);
```

### Example App

Take a look at the
[Example Application](https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-csharp/tree/main/ExampleApp) for
examples on how to use the available C# models to call the Dwolla API. Before you can begin using the app, however, you will need to specify a `DWOLLA_APP_KEY` and
`DWOLLA_APP_SECRET` environment variable.

#### Docker

If you prefer to use Docker to run ExampleApp locally, a Dockerfile file is included in the root directory. You can either build the Docker image with your API key and secret (by passing the values via CLI), or you can specify the values for the `app_key` and `app_secret` build arguments in Dockerfile. Finally, you will need to build and run the Docker image. More information on this topic can be found on [Docker's website](https://docs.docker.com/build/hellobuild/), or you can find some example commands below.

##### Building Docker Container

```shell
# Building container by specifying build arguments.
# In this configuration, you will not need to modify Dockerfile. All of the
# necessary arguments are passed via Docker's `--build-arg` option.
$ docker build \
    --build-arg app_key=YOUR_API_KEY \
    --build-arg app_secret=YOUR_APP_SECRET \
    -t dwolla/csharp-example-app:latest .
    
# Building container without specifying build arguments.
# In this configuration, you will need to specify your account API key and 
# secret (retrieved from Dwolla) in the Dockerfile file.
$ docker build -t dwolla/csharp-example-app:latest .
```

##### Running Container Instance

```shell
# Running Docker container in interactive shell
$ docker run --init -it dwolla/csharp-example-app:latest
```
